# Welcome to Rookie Route repository
#Rookie Route Project Overview
Rookie Route is an AI-based open-source educational tool designed to help beginner developers improve their coding habits and skills. It analyzes code submitted by the user and provides personalized feedback generated by AI.


#Project Flow Summary
This project is divided into two main components: the Frontend (React.js) and the Backend (FastAPI), both contained within the demo repository (rookie-route-repository). Below is the core process by which a user's code analysis request is handled.
1. User Input: The user inputs and submits their code via the Frontend interface.
2. Request Transmission: The Frontend sends the code analysis request to the Backend (FastAPI) REST API.
3. AI Analysis and Storage: The Backend receives the request, calls the OpenAI API to perform AI code analysis, and saves the results along with the submitted code to the MySQL Database.
4. Feedback Return: The analyzed feedback is transmitted back through the Backend to the Frontend and displayed to the user.
5. Dashboard Support: The Backend aggregates statistical data from MySQL and provides the necessary data for dashboard visualization to the Frontend.

#Rookie Route Frontend
## Features
- User-friendly interface to input code for analysis
- Displays personalized feedback based on code input
- Designed for ease of use by students and novice developers

## Installation
To run this frontend locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: Version 16.x or higher
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) comes with Node.js by default

### Steps to Run
1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rookie-route/rookie-route-repository.git
    cd rookie-route-repository/frontend
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:

    ```
    http://localhost:5173
    ```

    You should see the app running locally.

## File Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for the frontend.
    - **`App.jsx`**: The main component that renders the application.
    - **`index.js`**: The entry point of the application.
    - **`components/`**: Contains reusable React components.




#Rookie Route Backend
# Rookie Route Backend

## Description
The backend of Rookie Route serves as the core logic processor for the application. It handles user requests, interacts with the OpenAI API to analyze code weaknesses, and manages data persistence using MySQL. Built with the FastAPI framework, it provides a high-performance, asynchronous REST API that communicates with the frontend dashboard.

## Features
AI Code Analysis: Integrates with OpenAI (GPT models) to detect logic errors, syntax issues, and efficiency problems.

Data Persistence: Stores user submissions and analyzed weakness data securely in a MySQL database.

Statistical Analysis: Aggregates user data to provide insights for the dashboard visualization.

Automatic Documentation: Provides interactive API documentation via Swagger UI.

## Installation
To run this backend locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

Python: Version 3.9 or higher

MySQL: Server must be running and a database (e.g., rookieroute_db) must be created.

### Steps to Run
#### Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/rookie-route/rookie-route-repository.git
cd rookie-route-repository/app/backend
```

#### Create a virtual environment (Optional but recommended):
```
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Configure Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and add your keys:
```
# MySQL 연결 정보 (<> 부분을 사용자, 비밀번호, 호스트, DB이름에 맞게 수정)
DATABASE_URL="mysql+mysqlconnector://<user>:<password>@<host>:<3306>/<db>"
# OpenAI API 키 (본인의 API 키 사용)
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-openai-api-key"
```

#### Start the server:
```
uvicorn app.backend.back_main:app --reload
```

#### Open your browser and navigate to the API documentation:
```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## File Structure
Here is a detailed explanation of the backend codebase:

app/: The main application directory.

main.py: The entry point of the application. It initializes the FastAPI app, connects the database engine, and registers the routers (review and dashboard).

database.py: Handles the database connection setup using SQLAlchemy. It creates the database engine and session factory to manage transactions.

models.py: Defines the database schema (ORM models). It describes the structure of tables like Submission (user code) and Weakness (analysis results).

schemas.py: Defines the data validation schemas using Pydantic. It ensures that the input/output data (JSON) between frontend and backend is in the correct format.

routers/: Contains the API route logic, separated by feature.

review.py: Handles code analysis requests. It sends the user's code to the OpenAI API, parses the JSON response, and saves the results to the database.

dashboard.py: Handles statistical data retrieval. It queries the database to count weakness types and returns formatted data for Chart.js visualization.

requirements.txt: Lists all the Python dependencies required for the project (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, OpenAI, etc.).

.env: (Not included in repo) Stores sensitive configuration variables like database credentials and API keys.
